We grow oyster and shiitake mushrooms in our purpose-built indoor farm in Manchester, and deliver them to local restaurants within one hour of harvest.\
We grow food with a purpose; to drastically reduce food miles and bring food production back to local communities. We’re using small urban spaces to grow incredibly fresh, great tasting food, and selling to restaurants in the city who share our passion for locally-sourced produce.
