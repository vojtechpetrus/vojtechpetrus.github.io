We grow oyster and shiitake mushrooms in our purpose-built indoor farm in Manchester, and deliver them to local restaurants within one hour of harvest.\
We grow food with a purpose; to drastically reduce food miles and bring food production back to local communities. Weâ€™re using small urban spaces to grow incredibly fresh, great tasting food, and selling to restaurants in the city who share our passion for locally-sourced produce.
