Dien and Gareth met at the University of Manchester where they both became interested in cities and sustainability. They wrote dissertations which focused on the technical and socio-economic aspects of indoor farming, and later decided to test their theoretical knowledge in the real world. They founded Hive Urban Farms in April 2017, with a vision of bring people and food closer together. Their indoor mushroom farm is the beginning of a much larger vision to make cities more self-sustainable, by combining various indoor farming methods like hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaponics and mushroom production.
